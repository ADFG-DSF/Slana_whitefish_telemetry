# Slana_whitefish_telemetry

This study will describe the seasonal distribution of humpback whitefish *Coregonus pidschian* captured in the Slana River during fall. Humpback whitefish will be captured using electrofishing techniques during late September before the onset of spawning. One hundred adult humpback whitefish â‰¥320 mm FL will be surgically implanted with radio tags that will operate for \~25 months. Radiotagged humpbacked whitefish will be aerially tracked throughout the year to determine overall distribution, including overwintering, spawning, and summering areas, as well as migration timing among these locations. A fixed-tracking station will be used to track if/when humpback whitefish leave the Slana River drainage.
